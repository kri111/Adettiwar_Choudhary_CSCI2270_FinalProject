# Adettiwar_Choudhary_CSCI2270_FinalProject

Krishna Adettiwar and Tanay Choudhary will be working together for the CSCI 2270 Final Project. For our project, we are going to design and build a program for the customers of mailing services. We are going to primarily be working with doubly linked lists. We are going to first build a network of cities in which each node of the linked list represents a city. Depending on how the customer wants to send his/her package, details about the shipment will be given by the program. The customer can choose whether to do ground shipping or 2-day air shipping, and depending on which option is chosen, the path the package will take to reach its destination will change. The cost and tracking services within the program will also change accordingly. The cost will be dependant on the shipping type selected, weight, and distance. The program will also have a "special services" section where big packages (furniture, cars etc.) can be sent to the specific cities that support these special packages. The program will feature: shipping type and speed, tracking, cost, weight, estimated delivery date, shipping history, name of sender and reciever, scheduled pick-up, and special services. Depending on whether the customer wants to send out a new package or check the status of their in-transit package, the program will give the appropriate options using its feature set.
